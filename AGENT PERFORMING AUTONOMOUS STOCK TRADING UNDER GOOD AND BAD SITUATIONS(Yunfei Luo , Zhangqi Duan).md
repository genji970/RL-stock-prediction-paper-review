code will be added after I complete coding this paper

paper name : AGENT PERFORMING AUTONOMOUS STOCK TRADING UNDER GOOD AND BAD SITUATIONS(Yunfei Luo , Zhangqi Duan)

abstract : RL showed robust on many tasks in time series. So, using trained agent with stock datas,  
doing a real world simulation \-\> result was impressive before coivd and even though result decreased a lot,   
it is still positive for after 2021\.

RL uses monte carlo method to build trajectory. And because it is MC method, t+1 time is not affected by time 0 \~ t-1. It somehow show insight
